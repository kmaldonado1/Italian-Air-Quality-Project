Investigating Air Quality of Italian Region using Modeling, Time Series and Clustering Analysis

In this project, we examine the air quality data sourced from the UCI database, which provides 9358 instances of hourly averaged responses from five metal oxide chemical sensors located in an Italian city from March 2004 to April 2005. The sensors measure concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO), non-methanic hydrocarbons, benzene, total nitrogen oxides (NOx), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).

Our objectives are to identify the primary contributors to air pollution, predict future concentrations of these pollutants, and explore the impact of human activities on air quality. To achieve these goals, we employ a range of analytical techniques including modeling, time series analysis, and clustering. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to facilitate the visualization of data groupings and discern patterns based on hourly and daily variations.

The project is structured to provide insights into environmental data science and its application in real-world scenarios, helping us understand and mitigate air quality issues effectively.
